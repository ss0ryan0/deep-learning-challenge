# Report
## Overview
* The purpose of this analysis is to determine what models most accurately predict the data based on the targets, features, neurons, layers, and activation functions.
## Results
### Data Processing:
* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  * _**The Application Type, the Class, and the Name**_
* What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  * _**'IS_SUCCESSFUL': the success status**_
* What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  * **_Except for attempt 2, the EIN and NAME were removed. In attempt 2, with the help and suggestion of a tutor, the Name was put back in._**

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
